<h1 align="center">⊹˚✧Active Directory Inactive User Management Script✧˚⊹</h1>

## Description ₍ᐢ. .ᐢ₎ ₊˚⊹♡
- The aim of this script was to create a more clear way to see which users are inactive in Active Directory, as the icons to symbolise a user being inactive are sometimes
  too small and hard to see.
- This script was designed to be ran either every week or month depending on how frequent your AD users are being updated.
- If any users are inactive their description will be updated to add "Inactive Account" to it, without deleting the original description. For any active users with
  "Inactive Account" in their description, it will be removed. 

## Usage Instructions ✮⋆˙
1. Copy and paste the script into Powershell as admin (please ensure you are using a version of Powershell that has the Active Directory module). 
2. Run script :)
  
## Requirements +ꔫ:*
- Powershell with Active Directory Module
- Active Directory
